StarChaser
==========

The beginning to a platform game with a space theme. The story goes something like this:

*One day our hero goes on a midnight stroll to clear his/her head. After a while it becomes clear that some stars are missing. Our hero finds some stars laying around on the map and picks them up. A NPC (Jupiter/Carl Sagan/King of Cosmos) shows up and tells the our hero that some villain is steeling stars. The star hunt begins*


### Features so far:
* 2D map being created in an easy way.
* A player with animations for Idle, Jump, Fall and walk.
* Almost flawless collisions between player and map.
* A cool animated background.
* Super mario style horizontal scrolling map.
* Stars to collect!
* A door to progress to the next level

### What I would want in the near future:
* Perfect player collisions, jumping up into something stops both horizontal and vertical speed, not good.
* A really simple NPC/Talk system to get the story out.
* Dangerous water, everyone knows water is the Achilles heal of platform characters
* Enemies to watch out for

### What i would want in the long run
* Randomized chracter looks. Skin tone, sex, hair, color of cloths
* A short story with 4-10 levels with astronomi themed jokes.
* Boss battles?
* Dangerous things! Black holes, gamma rays, Aliens, MIB etc.
* Music and sounds
* A simple menu system with settings
* Having all the graphics easily replaced since I have friends that want to do their own.
